# Console Render
This repository is for my small console render projects. The method for rendering into the console is gracefully stolen from javidx9.
These will not work on linux since it uses functions from <windows.h>. The three dll files need to be downloaded and put in the same folder as the executable for it to work.

The only project so far is a 2D raycaster to simulate a 3D perspective like in old Doom games.
