# Basic2DRaycast
As its name says, this is a basic 2d raycast renderer in the style of older doom games.
I used javidx9's method to render whatever I want on the console way faster than regular printf functions and coded the raycast logic myself.
https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/CommandLineFPS is the code I was inspired from.

This code will only work on Windows as we use the <windows.h> header file. It does not require anything other than a c++ compiler to run.
